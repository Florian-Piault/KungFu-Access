					I had fits of laughter watching the big fat Panda struggle to keep up
					with his accidental ‘Dragon Warrior’ title but I still remember
					something extraordinary from the movie. <br />
					Oogway.<br />
					Yes, the wise tortoise.<br />
					Without Oogway’s guidance, there wasn’t a chance that an indolent,
					slacker panda who did nothing except dreaming about learning Kung Fu
					could have become the Dragon Warrior.
					<br /><br />
					I remember the scene when Po is rejected by Master Shifu and mocked by
					Furious Five. With his self-confidence shattered, he decides to quit
					and tell Master Oogway about it just when from the thin air, Oogway
					appears and says-

					Oh boy! How I wish I had my own Oogway constantly reminding me that I
					am more than what I think. That if I believe in myself, I can do it.
					That I just need to work on it, one more time. Wouldn’t it be great if
					we all had someone to show us the right path; help us become a better
					version of us? Help us find our destiny, you know. <br />Wishful
					thinking, I know. <br /><br />
					Mentors like him are often portrayed in the fantasy world of movies
					and storybooks. Like the Yoda. Or the badass Gandalf.
					<br /><br />
					Even in real life, we know of great mentor relationships and the
					phenomenal impact they created — Imagine Alexander the Great if
					Aristotle had not mentored him. Imagine Oprah Winfrey as just another
					woman without Mrs. Duncan guiding her. And Henry Ford without Thomas
					Edison.
					<br /><br />
					In fact every famous entrepreneur, athlete, writer, musician, business
					leader, singer ,or spiritual leader accredits a great mentor to their
					success.
					<br /><br />
					So my point is — we all need mentors. Especially in the corporate
					world. We need them because mentorship done right can have a
					tremendous impact on one’s career trajectory. Good Mentors are one
					helluva sounding board. They help you get unstuck. They uplift. They
					help you get some fresh perspective on things.
					<br /><br />But, please, don’t jump at it because I said it. Before
					you seek out to find your Master Oogway, you need to figure what you
					want to achieve. Pull out your inner intellectual Simon Sinek and
					start with why. <br /><br />Depending on your profession and your
					experience, your reasons might differ. Do you want someone to help you
					abridge knowledge gaps? Do you want to change your career direction?
					Or need someone to help you unlock business opportunities? Or build a
					business strategy?
				</p>
				<h2>
					Once you have your Why, go to What should you look for in a mentor
				</h2>
				<p class="txt-courant">
					Foremost, Trustworthiness, and Experience (irrespective of their age).
					To quote some examples, I would say pretty much like the Kabir Khan of
					Chak De. Or like Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid. Or, like Jedi masters
					from the Star Wars universe. *Yes, I am a movie junkie*
					<br /><br />Also, figuring out things like — if they have the time to
					mentor, have a genuine interest in your growth, can give constructive
					criticism and be hard on you, are a must. Without these, you would be
					become like Wolverine — always looking at the moon with longing, but
					never having it in your reach.

					<br /><br />Feels like you cracked a jackpot? But let me break your
					heart. I lied — Finding a good mentor isn’t as easy as it sounds. It’s
					like wandering through a maze and looking for something you can barely
					describe. However, some smart industry people have figured out How to
					Find a Career Mentor. Take help, if you need.

					<br /><br />Even the popular saying,
					<b>“when the student is ready, the master appears”</b>, requires the
					student to be ready to walk that path. But, nevertheless, take that
					road. Be on that journey to find a good mentor. Trust me, when you
					find that person who will say these words to you “I would love to help
					you”, that moment will be magical. <br /><br />I hope you are ready
					and your Oogway appears. And whispers in your ears-

									Very well said Tarun! Love the Oogway analogy. Thanks for the
									pointers — A mentor is easily one of the most important people
									in ones life and finding the right person is a combination of
									a lot of hard work with intent on the part of the student and
									some degree of luck :)..or maybe in this case, luck favors
									those who strive! I like how you end with ‘You must believe’
									because it all comes down to that.
